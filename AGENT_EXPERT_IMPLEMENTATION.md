# Agent Expert Implementation - Invoice Database Project

## Overview
This document explains the **Agent Experts Pattern** implementation for the Invoice Database project, demonstrating how TAC Framework + Elite Context Engineering creates self-improving, specialized agents with institutional knowledge.

## What Was Built

### 1. Agent Expert Triplet: `invoice_parsing`

Located in `.claude/commands/experts/invoice_parsing/`, this is a self-improving expert specialized in invoice data extraction:

#### Components

**A. `plan.md` - The Expert Planner** (.claude/commands/experts/invoice_parsing/plan.md:1)
- **Purpose**: Domain expert in invoice parsing strategy and planning
- **Expertise Includes**:
  - PDF/Word document parsing (pdfplumber, python-docx, pytesseract)
  - Data extraction patterns (invoice fields, line items, customer data)
  - Database schema design (normalized 3NF structure)
  - Deduplication strategies (content hashing + fuzzy matching)
  - Technical stack knowledge (FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Alembic)
- **Workflow**: 6-step planning process from requirements analysis to spec creation
- **Knowledge Base**: Self-updating section for lessons learned, patterns, edge cases

**B. `build.md` - The Expert Builder** (.claude/commands/experts/invoice_parsing/build.md:1)
- **Purpose**: Implementation expert with deep coding knowledge
- **Expertise Includes**:
  - Parsing implementation patterns (regex, table detection, OCR)
  - Code structure best practices (modular functions, type hints, error handling)
  - Data processing techniques (date normalization, currency parsing, fuzzy matching)
  - Database operations (SQLAlchemy patterns, transactions, bulk inserts)
  - Testing patterns (unit tests, fixtures, edge cases)
- **Workflow**: 10-step implementation process from reading plan to validation
- **Code Templates**: Complete templates for parsers, validators, tests
- **Knowledge Base**: Implementation patterns, common bugs, performance optimizations

**C. `improve.md` - The Self-Improving Analyzer** (.claude/commands/experts/invoice_parsing/improve.md:1)
- **Purpose**: Analyzes implementations and updates expert knowledge
- **Expertise Includes**:
  - Code quality metrics (coverage, complexity, error rates)
  - Pattern recognition (successful extraction patterns)
  - Edge case detection (failure scenarios)
  - Performance analysis (bottlenecks, optimizations)
- **Workflow**: 6-step improvement cycle from analysis to knowledge base updates
- **Self-Improvement Process**:
  - After each batch: Analyze failures, update edge cases
  - After features: Document successful patterns
  - Weekly review: Track metrics and trends
  - Monthly analysis: Generalize patterns, refactor code
- **Outputs**: YAML-structured improvement reports with metrics and proposals

### 2. Integration with TAC Framework

The Agent Expert integrates seamlessly with existing TAC workflows:

**Existing TAC Workflows** (can use the expert):
- `adw_plan_iso.py` - Planning phase can invoke `/experts:invoice_parsing:plan`
- `adw_build_iso.py` - Build phase can invoke `/experts:invoice_parsing:build`
- `adw_review_iso.py` - Review phase can invoke `/experts:invoice_parsing:improve`
- `adw_sdlc_iso.py` - Full lifecycle with expert at each phase

**How to Invoke** (planned for adw_expert_invoice.py):
```python
# Phase 1: Expert Plan
plan_request = AgentTemplateRequest(
    agent_name="invoice_parsing_planner",
    slash_command="/experts:invoice_parsing:plan",
    args=[task_description],
    adw_id=adw_id,
    output_style="verbose-yaml-structured"  # Detailed planning
)

# Phase 2: Expert Build
build_request = AgentTemplateRequest(
    agent_name="invoice_parsing_builder",
    slash_command="/experts:invoice_parsing:build",
    args=[plan_file],
    adw_id=adw_id,
    output_style="concise-done",  # Just confirmation
    context_handoff={"plan_file": plan_file}  # ECE handoff
)

# Phase 3: Expert Improve
improve_request = AgentTemplateRequest(
    agent_name="invoice_parsing_improver",
    slash_command="/experts:invoice_parsing:improve",
    args=[],
    adw_id=adw_id,
    output_style="verbose-yaml-structured"  # Detailed analysis
)
```

### 3. ECE Integration Points

**Already Implemented** (from ECE_INTEGRATION_COMPLETE.md:1):
- ✅ Output Styles: All 5 styles available in `.claude/output-styles/`
- ✅ Context Handoff: `adws/adw_modules/context_handoff.py`
- ✅ Metrics Tracking: `adws/adw_modules/metrics.py`
- ✅ Modified Execution Layer: `adws/adw_modules/agent.py` supports ECE

**New: Agent Expert** (Priority 2 from ECE_TRANSCRIPT_ANALYSIS.md:337):
- ✅ Self-improving triplet pattern (Plan → Build → Improve)
- ✅ Institutional knowledge capture in knowledge base sections
- ✅ Domain specialization (invoice parsing expert)
- ✅ Compound value over time (expert learns from each use)

## How It Works: Self-Improving Loop

### First Iteration: Learning Phase
```
1. User: "Extract invoice data from sample PDFs"
2. Plan Expert:
   - Analyzes 5 sample PDFs
   - Identifies patterns (invoice #, date, line items)
   - Creates extraction plan with regex patterns
   - Knowledge Base: Empty (first run)

3. Build Expert:
   - Implements PDF parser with patterns from plan
   - Creates validators and tests
   - Processes 5 samples
   - Result: 80% parsing accuracy
   - Knowledge Base: Empty (first run)

4. Improve Expert:
   - Analyzes failures (2 PDFs failed, 1 partial)
   - Identifies issues:
     * Multi-page tables not handled
     * European date formats not recognized
   - Updates plan.md: "Edge case: Multi-page tables"
   - Updates build.md: "Bug fix: Use dateutil for date parsing"
   - Proposes improvements for next iteration
```

### Second Iteration: Improvement Phase
```
1. User: "Process next batch of 100 invoices"
2. Plan Expert:
   - Reads updated knowledge base
   - NOW KNOWS: Multi-page tables are common
   - NOW KNOWS: Multiple date formats exist
   - Creates plan addressing known edge cases
   - Knowledge Base: 2 edge cases documented

3. Build Expert:
   - Reads updated knowledge base
   - NOW KNOWS: dateutil works better than strptime
   - NOW KNOWS: Table merging pattern from previous fix
   - Implements with lessons learned
   - Result: 93% parsing accuracy (+13% improvement!)
   - Knowledge Base: 2 patterns documented

4. Improve Expert:
   - Analyzes new failures (7 invoices failed)
   - Identifies new edge case: "Handwritten annotations interfere with OCR"
   - Updates knowledge bases
   - Tracks metrics: Accuracy improved 80% → 93%
```

### Nth Iteration: Expert Mastery
```
After 10 iterations:
- Knowledge Base has 20+ edge cases documented
- Knowledge Base has 15+ proven extraction patterns
- Parsing accuracy: 97%+
- Processing speed: 3x faster (optimizations learned)
- Expert specializes in this project's invoice ecosystem
```

## The Compound Value Proposition

### Traditional Approach (No Expert)
```
Each invoice parsing task:
1. Developer researches PDF parsing
2. Writes extraction code
3. Encounters edge case
4. Debugs and fixes
5. Knowledge lost when developer leaves
6. Next developer repeats steps 1-5

Result: Linear progress, knowledge decay
```

### Agent Expert Approach
```
Each invoice parsing task:
1. Expert reads accumulated knowledge base
2. Expert avoids known pitfalls
3. Expert uses proven patterns
4. Expert encounters new edge case
5. Expert documents lesson learned
6. Knowledge compounds for next iteration

Result: Exponential progress, knowledge accumulation
```

## Metrics & ROI

### Expected Improvement Curve

**Iteration 1 (Baseline)**:
- Parsing accuracy: 80%
- Lines of code: 500
- Development time: 8 hours

### Learning Multiplier

The expert improves at a compounding rate:
```
Learning Multiplier = Current Accuracy / Previous Accuracy

Iteration 1→2: 1.16x (80% → 93%)
Iteration 2→3: 1.04x (93% → 97%)
Iteration 3→4: 1.02x (97% → 99%)
Average: ~1.07x per iteration

Over 10 iterations: 1.07^10 = 1.97x (nearly 2x improvement)
```
