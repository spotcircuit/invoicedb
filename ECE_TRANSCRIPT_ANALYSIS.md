## Missing High-Value Techniques ⭐

### 1. **Context Bundles** (Advanced Level) ⭐⭐⭐⭐

**What It Is:**
Automatic tracking of ALL tool operations (reads, writes, searches) during a Claude Code session, stored as an append-only log that can be used to restore context in future sessions.

**How It Works:**
```python
# Via hooks: pre_tool_use.py and post_tool_use.py
# Automatically captures:
agents/context_bundles/{session_id}_{datetime}.jsonl

# Format:
{"type":"read","path":"file1.ts","timestamp":"..."}
{"type":"write","path":"file2.ts","timestamp":"..."}
{"type":"search","pattern":"...","timestamp":"..."}
```

**Value:**
- **Session Restoration**: Resume work without re-reading everything
- **Context Replay**: Get 60-70% of previous agent's context
- **Debugging**: Full audit trail of what agent did
- **Learning**: Analyze agent behavior patterns

**Integration with TAC:**
```python
# In workflows, after context explodes:
from adw_modules.context_bundle import ContextBundle

bundle = ContextBundle.load_latest(adw_id)
bundle.restore_to_agent()  # Replays reads without re-executing

# Or via slash command:
claude /load_bundle agents/abc123/context_bundles/session_xyz.jsonl
```

**Implementation Effort**: Medium (requires hooks integration)
**ROI**: Very High (enables session continuity, saves re-reading time)

---

### 2. **Agent Experts Pattern** (Agentic Level) ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**What It Is:**
Self-improving, specialized agent triplets (Plan → Build → Improve) that become domain experts in specific parts of your codebase and auto-update their own knowledge.

**How It Works:**
```bash
# 3-step workflow:
/experts:hooks:plan "implement session logging"
  → Creates spec in specs/
  → Expert planner with domain knowledge

/experts:hooks:build specs/plan.md
  → Implements from spec
  → Expert builder with implementation patterns

/experts:hooks:improve
  → Analyzes git diff
  → Updates plan.md and build.md expertise sections
  → Self-documenting, self-improving
```

**Example Expert Structure:**
```markdown
# .claude/commands/experts/database/plan.md

## Purpose
You are the database schema expert for this project.

## Expertise
Based on previous implementations, you know:
- We use SQLAlchemy with Alembic migrations
- Migration files go in app/server/db/migrations/
- Always add indexes on foreign keys
- Use UTC timestamps with timezone=True
- Naming convention: {table}_{column}_idx

## Workflow
1. Analyze database change request
2. Review existing schema patterns
3. Create detailed migration plan
4. Consider performance implications
...
```

**Value:**
- **Self-Documenting**: Experts capture institutional knowledge
- **Self-Improving**: Improve step updates expertise after each use
- **Consistency**: Same patterns applied every time
- **Specialization**: Deep knowledge of specific code areas
- **Team Scaling**: Junior devs get senior-level guidance

**Integration with TAC:**
```python
# New workflow: adw_expert_iso.py
def execute_expert_workflow(domain, task_description):
    # Phase 1: Expert Plan
    plan_request = AgentTemplateRequest(
        agent_name=f"expert_{domain}_planner",
        slash_command=f"/experts:{domain}:plan",
        args=[task_description],
        adw_id=adw_id,
        output_style="concise-ultra"
    )

    # Phase 2: Expert Build
    build_request = AgentTemplateRequest(
        agent_name=f"expert_{domain}_builder",
        slash_command=f"/experts:{domain}:build",
        args=[plan_file],
        adw_id=adw_id,
        output_style="concise-done"
    )

    # Phase 3: Expert Improve (auto-updates expertise)
    improve_request = AgentTemplateRequest(
        agent_name=f"expert_{domain}_improver",
        slash_command=f"/experts:{domain}:improve",
        args=[],
        adw_id=adw_id,
        output_style="verbose-yaml"  # Need detailed analysis
    )
```

**Domains for InvoiceDB:**
- `pdf_parsing` - Expert in extracting invoice data from PDFs
- `database` - Expert in schema design and migrations
- `api` - Expert in FastAPI endpoint patterns
- `frontend` - Expert in React component architecture

**Implementation Effort**: High (requires careful prompt design)
**ROI**: Extremely High (compound value over time)

---

### 3. **System Prompt Append** (Agentic Level) ⭐⭐⭐

**What It Is:**
Fine-grained control over agent behavior by appending custom instructions to the system prompt.

**How It Works:**
```python
# In agent.py:execute_template()

if request.system_prompt_append:
    prompt += f' --append-system-prompt "{request.system_prompt_append}"'

# Example: Force incremental file reading
system_append = """
IMPORTANT: When using the read tool, always read in increments of 100 lines.
For example:
- read(file, offset=0, limit=100)
- Determine if you have enough information
- If not, read(file, offset=100, limit=100)
- Continue until you have enough to complete the task

When you respond with your final message, always prefix with ✅ or ❌ for success/failure.
"""

request = AgentTemplateRequest(
    agent_name="reader",
    slash_command="/implement",
    args=[plan_file],
    adw_id=adw_id,
    system_prompt_append=system_append  # NEW
)
```

**Value:**
- **Behavior Control**: Change how agents operate fundamentally
- **Token Savings**: Force reading in chunks saves input tokens
- **Consistency**: Enforce patterns across all operations
- **Debugging**: Add logging/reporting requirements

**Integration with TAC:**
```python
# Phase-specific system prompts
PHASE_SYSTEM_PROMPTS = {
    "plan": """
        Be extremely concise. Return ONLY the file path to the plan.
        No explanations, no commentary, just: specs/plan.md
    """,
    "build": """
        After each file write, confirm with: ✅ {filename}
        If any errors, immediately stop and report: ❌ {error}
    """,
    "test": """
        Read test files in 50-line increments to save tokens.
        Report only: PASS {count} | FAIL {count}
    """
}

request.system_prompt_append = PHASE_SYSTEM_PROMPTS[phase_name]
```

**Implementation Effort**: Low (one parameter addition)
**ROI**: High (fine-tuned control over behavior)

---

### 4. **Background Agent Execution** (Agentic Level) ⭐⭐

**What It Is:**
Kick off independent Claude Code instances in the background that report results to files.

**How It Works:**
```bash
# Via /background command:
/background "/quick-plan {task}" sonnet report.md

# Spawns new Claude process:
claude -p "/quick-plan {task}" \
  --model sonnet \
  --dangerously-skip-permissions \
  --output-format stream-json \
  > agents/{adw_id}/background/{task_id}/output.jsonl

# Monitors report.md for completion
```

**Value:**
- **Parallel Execution**: Multiple agents working simultaneously
- **Out-of-Loop**: Fire and forget for non-critical tasks
- **Resource Utilization**: Max compute usage

**Note**: TAC already has better parallel execution via git worktrees.

**Implementation Effort**: Medium
**ROI**: Low-Medium (worktrees already solve this)

---

### 5. **Slash Context Monitoring** (Foundational) ⭐

**What It Is:**
Use `/context` command to see exactly what's in the context window.

**Value:**
- Measure to manage
- Identify bloat
- Track optimization effectiveness

**Note**: This is a usage pattern, not a framework feature.
**Implementation**: Already available in Claude Code.

---

### 6. **MCP Server Discipline** (Beginner Level) ⭐

**What It Is:**
- Don't use default MCP config (`.mcp.json`)
- Explicitly load only needed MCPs with `--mcp-config {file} --strict-mcp-config`
- Example: Fire Crawl-only config consuming 6K tokens vs 24K for all MCPs

**Value**:
- 10-15% context window savings
- Faster agent startup

**Note**: This is usage guidance, not framework integration.
**TAC Already Does This**: Worktrees can have per-workflow MCP configs.

---

### 7. **Architect-Editor Pattern** (Intermediate Level) ✅

**What It Is:**
Separate planning from implementation with two agents.

**Status**: TAC already implements this extensively:
- `adw_plan_iso.py` → planner
- `adw_build_iso.py` → builder
- Full separation of concerns

**No Additional Work Needed.**

---

### 8. **Reset and Prime vs Compact** (Advanced Level) ⭐

**What It Is:**
- Avoid `/compact` command (you don't know what's retained)
- Use `/clear` + `/prime` instead (you know exactly what's loaded)

**Value**:
- Deterministic context state
- Reproducible agent behavior
- Prepares for out-loop execution

**Note**: This is a best practice, not a framework feature.
**TAC Alignment**: Each workflow starts fresh in isolated worktree (aligned).

---
